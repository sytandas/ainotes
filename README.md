# ainotes 🤖📓

A lightweight messy repo of my AI and machine learning practice — built from self-study and experiments.

This is a personal space for:
- Exploring concepts in machine learning and deep learning
- Trying out models using PyTorch, Scikit-learn so on
- Documenting hands-on learning through Jupyter notebooks

## 📁 Contents

- `basics/` — Intro to ML concepts and starter models  
- `deep_learning/` — Neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, etc.  
- `nlp/` — Natural Language Processing practice  
- `vision/` — Computer Vision projects and experiments  
- `utils/` — Helper scripts and code snippets

## 🚧 Disclaimer

This is a self-study repo — some notebooks may be incomplete, messy, or purely exploratory. It’s meant for learning, not production use.

## ✨ Why this repo?

To learn by doing for testing ideas, building intuition, and revisiting what I've learned.
