# ainotes 🤖📓

A lightweight messy repo of my AI and machine learning practice — built from self-study and experiments.

This is a personal space for:
- Exploring concepts in machine learning and deep learning
- Trying out models using PyTorch, Scikit-learn so on
- Documenting hands-on learning through Jupyter notebooks
